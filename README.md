Ensure accessibility (ARIA landmarks, keyboard support for accordions).

Animate interactive elements (like the carousel) with Framer Motion for polish.
3. Firebase Auth

Phase 2 provides data hooks that booking and community can surface.


Phase 3 depends on user identity & Firestore schemas from Phases 1–2.


Phase 4 can begin in parallel with Phase 3 once core Firestore setup is done.


Phase 5 builds atop data from all earlier phases—points earned from bookings, posts, and logins.
